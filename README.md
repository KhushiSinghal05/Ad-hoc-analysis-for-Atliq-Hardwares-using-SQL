<h2>ðŸ“„Overview</h2>
Atliq Hardwares, an imaginary leader in computer hardware manufacturing in India, is expanding its reach globally. The company's management faces challenges in making data-driven decisions quickly due to a lack of actionable insights.


To address this, the organization is conducting a SQL Challenge to evaluate potential junior data analysts who can leverage both technical and soft skills to derive insights from data. This repository showcases my participation in this challenge, where I analyze Atliq Hardwares' data to answer business - questions.
